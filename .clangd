# Clangd configuration for Game Audio Module
# This file helps clangd understand include paths and compilation settings

CompileFlags:
  # Try to use compile_commands.json if it exists (best option)
  # Note: Visual Studio generator doesn't create this by default
  CompilationDatabase: build
  
  # Explicit include paths - these work from any file location
  # clangd processes files from their directory, so we need paths relative to each file
  Add:
    # Source directory - where audio_manager.h, sound.h, etc. are located
    - -Isrc
    - -I../src
    - -I../../src
    - -I../../../src
    # Include directory - where miniaudio headers are located  
    - -Iinclude
    - -I../include
    - -I../../include
    - -I../../../include
    # Test common directory
    - -Itests/cpp
    - -I../tests/cpp
    - -I../../tests/cpp
    - -I../../../tests/cpp
    # Bindings directory
    - -Ibindings
    - -I../bindings
    - -I../../bindings
    - -I../../../bindings
    # C++ standard
    - -std=c++20
    # Windows-specific defines
    - -D_WIN32
