# Clangd configuration for Game Audio Module
# This file helps clangd understand include paths and compilation settings
#
# Note: clangd may run from different directories when processing files.
# Paths here are relative to where .clangd is located (workspace root).
# For files in src/, we need paths that work from src/ directory.

CompileFlags:
  Add:
    # Include directories - paths relative to workspace root
    # For files in src/ that include "miniaudio/miniaudio.h", we need ../include
    # For files in tests/cpp/ that include "audio_manager.h", we need ../src
    # For files in bindings/ that include headers, we need ../src

    # Windows-specific defines
    - -D_WIN32
    # Note: NOMINMAX is defined in source files, don't redefine here
  # Try to use compile_commands.json if available (best option)
  # Note: Visual Studio generator doesn't create compile_commands.json by default
  # For now, we rely on the explicit include paths above
